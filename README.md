# 2025 NARCH LLM Lab

This project is a workspace for the LLM hands-on lab activity!
The course materials can be found [here](https://dmice.ohsu.edu/bedricks/courses/narch_llm_summer_2025/); this directory contains the following resources:

- `workbook.qmd`: A Quarto workbook whose structure mirrors the various checkpoints in the lab documents linked above
- `lit_review.xlsx`: The literature search results dataset that you will be working with
- `.Renviron`: An R environment file pre-loaded with an OpenAI API key; this key will be deactivated shortly after the workshop, but you can replace it with your own key at any time and continue working.

The project itself is using [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to manage its package dependencies; hopefully this will make it easier to install the (minimal) set of libraries required.

## Some Things To Read

I don't pretend that this is any kind of comprehensive or exhaustive bibliography; please consider it a short and opinionated list of books that I have found informative and readable, as well as a few non-book articles that may be of interest.
Obviously there is _so_ much more I could have included!
